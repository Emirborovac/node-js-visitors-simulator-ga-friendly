This script simulates real user behavior through sophisticated browser automation, making it valuable for testing analytics implementations and understanding traffic patterns.

## Key Features
- Concurrent browser session management (up to 250 sessions)
- Mobile device emulation with diverse screen sizes
- Natural user behavior simulation (scrolling, clicking, mouse movements)
- Randomized session durations and interaction patterns
- Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
- Memory-efficient operation with automatic garbage collection
- WordPress API integration for dynamic content targeting

## Technical Highlights
- **Built with Node.js** for superior performance compared to Python alternatives
- **Playwright** for reliable browser automation
- **Efficient Resource Management:**
  - Dynamic session scaling
  - Automated cleanup processes
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Graceful error handling

## Performance Metrics
- Handles 250+ concurrent sessions
- 30-second average session duration
- Real-time user interaction simulation
- Sub-second response times for session creation
- Minimal memory footprint through efficient resource management

## Requirements
- Node.js >= 16.x
- SQLite3
- Playwright
- Minimum 8GB RAM recommended

## Limitations
